                <li>Download will begin automatically based on your selection.</li>
                <li>Once installed, connect your Ledger hardware wallet to your computer or mobile using the provided cable.</li>
                <li>Open the app and follow the guided setup instructions.</li>
                <li>If this is your first time, select the “Initialize as new device” option.</li>
                <li>Create a secure PIN code on the device screen.</li>
                <li>Write down your recovery phrase and store it somewhere safe and offline.</li>
                <li>Confirm the recovery phrase to finalize the setup.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once done, you’re ready to use Ledger Live to manage and track all your activity. Whether you're on desktop or mobile, the process stays consistent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Is Ledger Live a Secure Platform?</h2>
            <p>Yes, security is at the core of everything Ledger does. The hardware wallet ensures that all private information remains locked away offline. On top of that, the ledger live app adds an extra layer of protection through encrypted access, optional passphrases, and PIN validation.</p>
            <p>Even if your device is lost or stolen, access to your funds remains impossible without both the hardware and your secret recovery phrase. Ledger does not store this phrase or your private keys online, keeping control fully in your hands.</p>
            <p>From Ledger Live download to regular usage, each step is backed by strict security protocols. Regular firmware and app updates also keep your environment resilient to new threats.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Features of Ledger Live You Should Know</h2>
            <p>One of the best things about Ledger Live is how multifunctional it is. Here’s what you can do once your ledger wallet is connected:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track portfolio performance across different assets</li>
                <li>Review and confirm all transactions directly on the device</li>
                <li>Create and manage multiple accounts</li>
                <li>Set up passphrase protection</li>
                <li>Access the in-app services that let you expand or reorganize your setup</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each interaction is verified through the device to ensure authenticity, and every new action asks for user confirmation before proceeding.</p>
            <p>If you're someone who values clear oversight and simplified management, the Ledger Live download is definitely worth your time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Can You Use Ledger Live Without the Ledger Wallet?</h2>
            <p>No—you need the Ledger hardware device to use Ledger Live. The app itself is only the interface. It doesn’t hold or access any funds on its own.</p>
            <p>Think of Ledger Live as the dashboard, while the ledger wallet is the vault. The two work hand-in-hand and cannot function properly without one another. Without the hardware device, you won't be able to confirm transactions or set up new accounts.</p>
            <p>This tight integration is what makes the entire system secure. There’s no way to bypass the physical verification process, which is exactly why it's trusted by users who prioritize protection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">How to Access Your Wallet Again – Recovery Steps</h2>
            <p>If you've lost access to your app or had to reset your device, recovering your data is simple, provided you have the secret phrase saved during the initial setup.</p>
            <p>Here’s how you can restore access:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the ledger live app.</li>
                <li>Choose the "Restore device using recovery phrase" option.</li>
                <li>Enter your recovery phrase using the Ledger device.</li>
                <li>Set a new PIN for access.</li>
                <li>Once confirmed, your wallet will be restored, along with access to all previous accounts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Just ensure your recovery phrase is written down somewhere safe and not stored online. This is the key to your security and should be handled with the utmost caution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Updating Ledger Live – Keep Things Current</h2>
            <p>To make sure you're always using the most secure and feature-rich version of the app, it's important to keep Ledger Live updated.</p>
            <p>Visit ledger.com/start to download the newest version whenever an update is available. Updates usually bring in performance enhancements, interface improvements, and added compatibility with new features or security layers.</p>
            <p>After a Ledger Live download, the app will guide you through any firmware or app updates needed for your device.</p>
